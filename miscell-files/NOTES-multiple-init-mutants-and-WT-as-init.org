* Fitness of wildtype
- When fitness if FDF WT can have arbitrary values
- O.w. it is for now set by decree at 1  
- In C++ we represent the WT as a genotype of length 0
- For now, we emit notes/messages when evaluating length 0 genotypes


* An inconsistency
  - evalGenotype can take a genotype as "0" (the number) but initMutant
    does not accept that

* Multiple initMutants and initMutants in general
  - As of now, [2020-12-05 Sat], we have started, in C++, always dealing
    with initMutants as if initMutants were present. If they are not, the
    WT is the initMutant. Simplifies logic of the population
    initialization block.
