This branch tried to incorporate several plotting ideas from group 5 (2019-20). But
there are issues with the code that will need some work.

compositionPop2 has bugs

meanCompositionPop not done checking.


See also test_functions_group5.R: would need to check that code and add appropriate testing for the new plotting code.
